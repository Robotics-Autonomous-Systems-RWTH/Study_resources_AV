ROS (Robotic OS) 
ðŸ‘‰ ROS tutorials are a great help if you want to learn about the OS behind self-driving cars for free. You will work with command lines, and learn to build concrete projects.

Artificial Intelligence
ðŸ‘‰ I highly recommend Artificial Intelligence for Robotics by Udacity for a practical free introduction to self-driving cars.


G) Advanced C++ for computer vision,linux Cmake(build), git(Version control), gtest, gitlab(Project Management):

C++ - The Main Language
ðŸ‘‰ C++ Nanodegree, Udacity
Read my C++ interview with Udacity to launch this course here.

ðŸ‘‰ Beginning C++ Programming - From beginner to beyond, Udemy Course

Python - Useful to have
You shouldn't spend too much time on it, especially if you already have programming skills.
ðŸ‘‰ Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from Zero to hero in Python 3
ðŸ‘‰ Python Programming Masterclass

Basic Linux Command Lines
ðŸ‘‰ I'd say it's not necessary to take a course on this, learn while doing your projects and force yourself to use a Linux system.

These were languages, the other very important thing is maths.
Intermediate Probability
Intermediate Calculus
Intermediate Linear Algebra
ðŸ‘‰ You can learn these on Khan Academy
